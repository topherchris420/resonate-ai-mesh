# Resonate AI 

**Resonate AI** is a multimodal AI integration and orchestration platform designed to connect any generative model (text, image, audio, biosignal) to any system or sensor—without writing custom code. It enables ambient-aware, signal-driven workflows using standardized AI connectors, a cymatic input/output layer, and dynamic resonance visualization.

## 🔍 Overview

Resonate AI Mesh enables:

- **Model-agnostic routing** across OpenAI, Claude, Midjourney, and open-source models
- **Ambient agent triggers** from voice, biosignals, environmental input, or temporal patterns
- **Cymatic IO Layer** to translate vibrational, audio, or physiological signals into AI-compatible symbolic representations
- **Visual workflow builder** to chain, switch, and monitor AI service interactions
- **Dynamic Resonance Rooting (DRR)** visualization to observe AI adaptation over time

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🧩 Model Integration Layer
- One-click switching across AI APIs without code changes
- Unified input/output formatting across heterogeneous AI services
- Native support for LLMs, image generators, voice models, and transcription tools

### 🌀 Cymatic IO Layer
- Converts ambient frequencies, speech, or breath into structured prompts or tokens
- Visual representations of vibrational input/output for creative and wellness use cases

### 📡 Ambient Agent Mesh
- Real-time workflows triggered by sound, tone, biosignals (HRV, GSR), motion, and IoT
- WebSocket and MQTT support for environmental sensing

### 📊 Analytics + DRR View
- Cost and performance tracking per model
- Time-based DRR graphs visualizing system resonance and model dominance patterns
